Include examples in your Rustdocs.

## Features

- Write and maintain your examples in a normal Rust file, with full editor support.
- Automatically hide imports.
- Put many examples into one file, and choose the parts of the file to include. This helps avoid duplicated boilerplate for imports and setup code.

See the crate docs for examples.
